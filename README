SCE REMOTE PRINTER V-3.0

This software is a custom software built to enable users to print remotely by logging into an existing portal site. 
The portal site is not included in this software and is a separated project. 

Set up requires admin to know some basic Unix command such as cd, ls, chown, chmod. Please also have the following
technologies on your Unix/Mac OS machine. 

Dependencies:
1) xpdf - http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
	To install:
		sudo apt-get install xpdf
2) libcups2-dev
	Run the following:
		sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev
Extra) cpdf - http://community.coherentpdf.com/
	A binary file of this program should be included in this package, if not please visit cpdf website to download the binaries.
	Make sure to update the cpdf path in the Config file once you have included the cpdf binaries in this package.

Out of service (This section is for information purposes only, no action required):
Imagick - http://php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php 
		sudo apt-get install php5-imagick
		sudo service apache2 reload
	

Procedures:

Pre-run: #### IMPORTANT ####
Inside index.php, please set DEV_MODE and SOFFICE_NEEDED accordingly. DEV_MODE should be true when developing, and SOFFICE_NEEDED should be true when using a Mac OS 

1) CUPS 1.7.2 Configuration @ localhost:631/admin
	.Set a working printer as 'server default'
	To check if printer is defaulted. Run
	lpstat -d
	The result should say something like this
	"system default destination: Photosmart-C3100-series"

2) File system configuration 
	Run the following command with your username:

		mkdir temporary_file_storage
		sudo chown username:www-data temporary_file_storage && sudo chmod 775 temporary_file_storage 
		mkdir spool
		sudo chown username:www-data spool && sudo chmod 775 spool

	The following folders should have the equivalent of the following permissions:
	
		drwxrwxr—x   2 username   www-data    68 Jun  7 15:11 temporary_file_storage
		drwxrwxr-x   2 username   www-data  4096 Jun 29 22:06 spool

	
	There should also be a job-state binary file inside php/job_state_reporter/ 

	Note: Apache in Ubuntu runs as www-data; Mac Apache runs as _www
	
	Look inside php/config/Config.php to configure application options, including database credentials, etc.

3) Apache/PHP increase upload_max_filesize:
In order to accommodate file upload of 10MB, you need to manual increase that size in your php.ini. In order to do that, do the following:
		cd /etc/php5/apache2/
		sudo gedit php.ini
	
	Find the following key words: upload_max_filesize and post_max_size. Change the values of these options to 10M and 11M respectively. 	     Once done, make sure to save and exit. Now restart apache2 by running the following command.
	
	Run the following command, you might run into this error:
	AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName'     		directive globally to suppress this message

		sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
	
	If you are experiencing this error. Do the following 
		sudo gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
	then add 
		ServerName localhost
	at the end of the file, save then exit. Now try restarting again. If this fails, you will need to look up how to solve this online.


4) Databases setup: 	
The database scheme is available in this project at php/config/ - to keep this up-to-date, please try to get the database from SCE server and commit to master branch.

	To install database:
		Open your mysql workbench.
		Log into your root account.	
		Create a new user in MySQL. 
		Hit "Users and Privileges" in left menu. 
		Then hit "Add Account" at bottom left. 
		Enter the following for each section:

		  Login Name: Printer 
		  Authentication Type: Standard
		  Limit to Hosts Match: localhost
		  Password: @sce123 

		Then in the Administrative Roles tab, hit DBA.
		Done. Now you need to run the script to create the database. To do this open the sql script in /path/to/sce_printer/php/config/
		and execute it in mysql workbench. If you don't see anything pop up, refresh your schemas. 

	Note, you may choose your own login name and password; just be sure to match them in Config.php

Application corner Case: 
.docx require “.docx” in name to work.
